## May 2025 - Tailwind v4 and React 19

It's here! Support for Tailwind v4 and React 19 is now available. We've updated all components following shadcn/ui's [Tailwind v4](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/tailwind-v4#whats-new) guidelines and adopted their [component registry](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/registry) system. Along with these updates, we've also updated our documentation site to provide a better experience. It is now recommended to start with the latest version when building new projects.

Looking for the previous version? You can find the v3 documentation at [v3-ui-x.junwen-k.dev](https://v3-ui-x.junwen-k.dev).
