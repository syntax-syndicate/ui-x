title: Introduction
description: Additional beautifully designed components that you can copy and paste into your apps. Accessible. Customizable. Open Source.
---

Similar to shadcn/ui, this is **NOT** a component library. It's a collection of re-usable components that you can copy and paste into your apps.

As junwen-k/ui-x is an extension of shadcn/ui, most documentation remains applicable. For more information, please visit shadcn/ui's [documentation](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs).

## Philosophy

Our API is designed to mirror the conventions of Radix UI, creating a consistent and intuitive experience for developers. Each component's API has been thoughtfully crafted to align closely with the shadcn library style, ensuring that it feels like a natural extension of the existing component library. I've invested considerable time into refining these designs to maintain a high standard of quality and coherence across the entire API.

## FAQ

  <AccordionItem value="faq-1">
    <AccordionTrigger>How it works?</AccordionTrigger>
    <AccordionContent>
      With the recent update to the shadcn CLI, which now supports installing
      remote components via URL, we can easily leverage this feature to install
      our extended components.

  <AccordionItem value="faq-2">
    <AccordionTrigger>Why are there additional primitives?</AccordionTrigger>
    <AccordionContent>
      This extension library includes additional primitive components, as Radix
      UI does not provide them. By separating the primitive logic from the
      styled counterparts, we can focus on styling more effectively, resulting
      in cleaner and more maintainable code.
